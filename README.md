A tool to help trainers find type matchings/dual types/team compositions.

Completed:

    Defensive dual type calculator
    
    Offensive dual type calculator
    

Needs improving:

    Offensive score needs more meaning
    More in-code notes
    Clean up + Qoc
    UI (I don't know good UI)
    

Needs to be done:
    Form + functionality for:
        Two pokemon's type coverage + score
        Raw Type Table
        Every type combo output at once 
    Functionality for:
        Calculating pokemon stats at each level/ev/iv
    A DB or class file with all pokemon
        Needs to have:
          Name
          Type (both if two, Null if single type)
          Base stats
          Move list
